# Minimal-Scrollbars
Minimal Scrollbars is a browser extension developed for Chromium-based browsers. It is for users who focus on keeping a clean and uncluttered workspace while surfing on the internet.

Turn Chrome's and Edge's traditional scrollbars into ones that are designed minimally, helping you keep your browsing experience aesthetically pleasing and clean.

Tip: For users who love Notion (www.notion.so) but hate the default scrollbars that hinder the layout, give this a try!

## Salient Features
- The sharp edges of the scrollbar have been chipped off to make it rounded.
- The color of the scrollbar is soft grey and is optimized for both light and dark modes. 
- The track on which the bar runs has been made transparent.
- Scrollbar color changes on hover interaction

## Future Updates
- Auto-hide the scrollbar when not in use.
- Interactive animations for the scrollbar on drag and hover.
- Simple UI to customize the scrollbar and scroll track features such as color, outline, shadow and more.


Take a note:
Websites that have their own custom defined scrollbars cannot be overridden (for example, Google web services such as Gmail).
