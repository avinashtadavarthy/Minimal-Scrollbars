# Minimal-Scrollbars
Minimal Scrollbars are for users who focus on keeping a clean and uncluttered workspace.

Turn Chrome's and Edge's traditional scrollbars into ones that are designed minimally, helping you keep your browsing experience aesthetically pleasing and clean.

Tip: For users who love Notion (www.notion.so) but hate the default scrollbars that hinder the layout, give this a try!

## Salient Features
- The sharp edges of the scrollbar have been chipped off to make it rounded.
- The color of the scrollbar is soft grey and is optimized for both light and dark modes. 
- The track on which the bar runs has been made transparent.
- Scrollbar color changes on hover interaction

## Future Updates
- Auto-hide the scrollbar when not in use.
- Interactive animations for the scrollbar on drag and hover.
- Simple UI to customize the scrollbar and scroll track features such as color, outline, shadow and more.


Take a note:
Websites that have their own custom defined scrollbars cannot be overridden (for example, Google web services such as Gmail).
